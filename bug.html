I'm encountering an issue where Tailwind CSS classes aren't being applied correctly to my elements.  I've double-checked my CSS file for typos and made sure the Tailwind directives are included properly in my HTML file, but the styles aren't reflecting in the browser. For instance, the class `bg-blue-500` is not rendering the element blue. My setup includes using the `@tailwind` directive within my CSS file, and I've confirmed that the Tailwind CSS configuration file exists and is correctly configured. This problem only happens in production mode, the styles are applied correctly in the development environment.
