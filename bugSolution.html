The solution lies in correctly configuring the `purge` option in your `tailwind.config.js` file.  This option specifies which files Tailwind should scan for class names.  If it's not configured correctly, or is missing entirely, Tailwind may remove classes that are used in your application, resulting in styles not being applied. 

```javascript
// tailwind.config.js
module.exports = {
  purge: [ //This array should include all of your template files. 
    './src/**/*.html', //Example paths for HTML files.
    './src/**/*.js', //Example paths for JavaScript files. 
    './src/**/*.vue' //Example paths for Vue files. 
  ],
  // ... rest of your Tailwind config
}
```

Ensure that the paths within the `purge` array accurately reflect the location of your HTML and JavaScript files. Additionally, if you are using a framework like Vue or React, you might need to adjust the purge options to correctly handle your component structure. This may also require adding additional plugins or configurations to your build process to support Tailwind's purge functionality during production builds. Double check your build process to make sure it properly includes Tailwind's output CSS file into your production build.
